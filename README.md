My own application of Conway's Game of Life.

<hr>

*To Run:*
Using a terminal/command prompt:
Navigate to the src/ directory.
Compile the .java files with <code>javac \*.java</code>
Run with <code>java Main</code>

*Note: I'll have a .jar file eventually (as soon as I finish file i/o).*

<h4>Description</h4>
Based on Conway's Game of Life. Create cell worlds with survival/birth rulesets, set their initial states, and watch them develop!

*Open/Save not implemented yet.*

<hr>

<h4>Controls</h4>
Create a new cell world or open a saved world under the "File" menu.

Left-click to set a cell's initial state to "alive" (black).

Right-click to set a cell's initial state to "dead" (white).

Hit the start button to start the simulation. The rest of the buttons are also self-explanitory.
